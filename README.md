### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend tooling
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - For animations

### What I learned

Developing this static website, I put into practice the basic concepts of React, such as the JSX syntax, nested components, build-in/custom hooks, displaying data, conditional rendering, and handling events. I also refactor this project, taking into consideration the composition pattern.

It also was an opportunity to learn new techs: the Styled Components for styling and Framer Motion for animations. Due to my good understanding of CSS, it was relativity quick and easy to learn the basics and apply these tools.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to learn and use more complex React concepts, like fetching data from an API and updating the UI or even trying React Router. Moreover, I plan to learn more about Framer Motion to build complex animations and try some CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS.
